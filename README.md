Harry Potter Memory and Quiz Game.

This is a Javascript game themed about the Harry Potter world. I chose those two games especially because I wanted to learn to delevelop something easy to play, for my further experience. I wanted to do somthing that anyone could learn, play easily, and have fun. When developing something I like the idea of inclusion, in the sense that most type of people could use what I have made. Like in these two games, that could by easily played by children or by elderly, for exemple.
Then I used the theme of Harry Potter because I am a fan!
